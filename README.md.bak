# The-Imitation-Game
This is the fourth project of the course Introduction to Artificial Intelligence at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick.

We used python version 3.8.12 and conda version 4.8.3 for this project.

For our final project we had to recreate one of the agents from each of our previous projects but try to improve upon them by using Neural Networks.
The details of our previous projects can be found

##### Project 1 Agent 1 recreation using DNN

We first used Dense Neural Networks to recreate our first agent. We tested a variety of different architectures. For our results below
we used the ones that gave us the best results.

As we can see we were able to recreate the agent with a fairly high level of accuracy of 99%.


##### Project 1 Agent 1 recreation using CNN

Next we used Convolutional Neural Networks to recreate our first agent. We tested a variety of different architectures. For our results below
we used the ones that gave us the best results.

As we can see we were again able to recreate the agent with a fairly high level of accuracy.

##### Project 2 Agent 1 recreation using DNN

We first used Dense Neural Networks to recreate our second agent. We tested a variety of different architectures. For our results below
we used the ones that gave us the best results.

	<img src="/images/Agent2.PNG">
</p>

As we can see we were able to recreate the agent with a fairly high level of accuracy of 95%.


##### Project 2 Agent 1 recreation using CNN

Next we used Convolutional Neural Networks to recreate our second agent. We tested a variety of different architectures. For our results below
we used the ones that gave us the best results. 

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/Agent2_2.PNG">
</p>

As we can see we were again able to recreate the agent with a fairly high level of accuracy.

##### Project 3 Agent 1 recreation using DNN

We first used Dense Neural Networks to recreate our third agent. We tested a variety of different architectures. For our results below
we used the ones that gave us the best results. 

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/Agent3.PNG">
</p>

We got a slightly lower accuracy of 85% here but this was still satisfactory. 


##### Project 3 Agent 1 recreation using CNN

Next we used Convolutional Neural Networks to recreate our third agent. We tested a variety of different architectures. For our results below
we used the ones that gave us the best results. 

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/Agent3_3.PNG">
</p>

We got similar results as our dense layers here.


As we can see from above we were successfully able to recreate one agent from each of our previous projects with a high enough level of accuracy using neural networks.
